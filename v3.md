# BibleBase V3

## Intro

V3 is expected to have these improvements in addition to [V2](./README.md#intro):

### Content

* Improved Bible Read
  * Red text for what Jesus said.
  * `浸` in replace of `洗` in various places.
  * Title and subtitles, book TOC.
  * Old testament links (especially in Matt.)
* More accurate Interlinear in Chinese
  * The quality of interinear in chinese in v2 has lots of rooms to be improved.
* Link old and new testamanets by words using greak translation of the old testament.
* The sermon references to verses can go beyond just the sermon title, but also into each slide.

### Indexing

* Search functions
  * search by keywords, in both English and Chinese
* Cross reference verses live generation, by the selected words

### Visualizations

* Dict
  * Frequency visualization in books/chapters
  * Synonyms
* Richer references
  * Places on map (e.g. book of Joshua, or Acts)
  * TOC of the book with hierachy of section titles and subtitles (when the titles are highlighted)
  * People introduction, with wikipedia-styled visualizations
  * People relationships chart
  * Timeline visualization when the bible verses have an implied chronology (e.g. Matt 1:1-17, or Kings)
  * Word statistics visualizations
    * top words in the book
    * common words in related books (e.g. "remnant" in prophet books)
  * Most referred verses could be a visualization of medal tally

### UX

* Material Design
  * Make it looks like an open bible
  * The bible has a scrollable text on the left, and a large margin on the right.
* Smart margin
  * While scrolling down, the verses (or titles) are highlighted automatically, and the margin content changes accroding to the currently highlighted verse.
  * The margin content are in tabs, the most relavant tab is shown on the top by default. E.g. Timeline visualization for Matt 1:1, Top words list for John 1:1.
  * Other tabs are hidden, but with clear indication that they can be brought to front too.
* Shortcut keys
  * Use arrow up and down to navigate between verses, and left and right to navigate chapters.
  * CMD arrow left and right to switch tabs on the smart margin.
  * Key shortcuts for functions, e.g. `/` for search
